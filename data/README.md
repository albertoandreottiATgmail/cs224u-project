# How to use preprocess.py

1. Make sure to first delete the ~30 lines of garbage from `yup_messages.csv`. It's important to retain the header.

2. Run the pre-processing script
```
python preprocess.py yup_messages.csv
```
This will take 10-15 minutes to complete. You should see messages printed to the console updating you on the status of the script.
